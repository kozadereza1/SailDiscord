# SailDiscord

A SailfishOS Discord client

Not working yet

**By using this, you are breaking Discord Terms of Services!**

I can forget about my projects and pause the developing, but then I come back (not always). I'm also new to developing SailfishOS apps, and it's really hard to find how to develop them.

## TODO

- [X] Package library with app
- [X] Login using Discord
- [X] Save token after logging in
- [X] Open the login page or the main page depending on is user logged in or not
- [X] Connect Python
- [X] Integrate discord.py-self
- [ ] Servers/DMs list
	- [ ] Servers
		- [X] Backend
		- [X] Connection
		- [ ] Frontend
	- [ ] DMs
		- [ ] Backend
		- [ ] Connection
		- [ ] Frontend
- [ ] Develop the whole app

There's an issue that the app refuses to build. A workaround for now is to build these two awesome projects for the same target as for this project - [harbour-moremahjong](https://github.com/poetaster/harbour-moremahjong) and [sailfish-rpn-calculator](https://github.com/poetaster/sailfish-rpn-calculator)
I haven't found a fix yet
