# SailDiscord

A SailfishOS Discord client

Not working yet

**By using this, you are breaking Discord Terms of Services!**

I can forget about my projects and pause the developing, but then I come back (not always). I'm also new to developing SailfishOS apps, and it's really hard to find how to develop them.

## TODO

- [X] Login using Discord
- [X] Save token after logging in
- [X] Open the login page or the main page depending on is user logged in or not
- [X] Connect Python
- [X] Integrate discord.py-self
- [ ] Develop the whole app

Credits to discord.py-self library
You should install that library on your device with pip via Terminal, which is a part of developer mode for SFOS in Settings

	pkcon install python3-pip
	pip install discord.py-self --user

Don't forget to add the --user option! Otherwise it won't work!
