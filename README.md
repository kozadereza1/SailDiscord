# SailDiscord

A SailfishOS Discord client

Not working yet

**By using this, you are breaking Discord Terms of Services!**

I can forget about my projects and pause the developing, but then I come back (not always). I'm also new to developing SailfishOS apps, and it's really hard to find how to develop them.

## TODO

- [X] Login using Discord
- [X] Save token after logging in
- [X] Open the login page or the main page depending on is user logged in or not
- [ ] Connect Python
- [ ] Develop the whole app
